StanleyCam is a pet monitor used to help us keep Stanley, our large tabby cat, off our kitchen counters. A Raspberry Pi 4 plus camera module are strategically placed on the countertop looking towards Stanley's preferred point of entry. Python and OpenCV are used to for cat facial recognition to detect when Stanley gets on the counter. A photo is taken of Stanley and uploaded to Cloudinary for storage, and an SMS text notification is sent to my phone with the photo URL embedded.
